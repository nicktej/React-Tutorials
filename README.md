This is my attempt at learning React.

I started off with the React Tic Tac Toe tutorial, then proceeded to create a project manager, Weather App, and finally the Game of Life. The Weather App utilizes a weather API. If you intend to clone my repo, please add node_modules to each project folder.

More projects coming soon. Stay tuned!
