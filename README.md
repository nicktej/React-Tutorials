# React Tutorials
This is my attempt at learning React.

I started off with the React Tic Tac Toe tutorial, then proceeded to create a project manager, Weather App, and finally the Game of Life. The Weather App utilizes a weather API. If you intend to clone my repo, please add node_modules to each project folder.

I enjoyed it, and hope to explore React more and dive deeper into it in the future.

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

You'll need node.js.
